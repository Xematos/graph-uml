We have a small cookbook where you can find examples on common use cases:

### Class Diagrams

* [Single Class](./Single_Class.md) to build class diagram of a single object (class or interface).

* [Multiple Classes](./Multiple_Classes.md) to build class diagram with many objects (class and interface).

### Extension Diagram

* [Two PHP extensions](./Php_Extensions.md) shown at same time.
